# Black Yak

Black yak is a simple Black Jack game coded on Java using "Light Weight Java Game Library", making everything OpenGL

## Installation

We don't have an installation method yet.
To be able to compile the code just select the configuration of the folder, select the JDK (I've used v15), add the vm option "-XstartOnFirstThread" and 
add the main Main. Also remember to select the MacOS config or the Windows config depending on your pc (sorry linux users lol).

## Usage

```
1) Start the game

2) Select how much money on chips you will bet (up to 500 in the beginning).

3) Get your 2 first cards and decide wether you hit or stand.
(You must try to hit close to 21 without getting more, and also winning
the dealer's hand).

4) Get your chips! (or loose some of them).

5) Repeat but now with your new amount of chips.
```
